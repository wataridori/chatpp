Chat++ Change Logs

## 5.10.0
- Auto Shorten Link Feature Added.
- Quick Title Tag

## 5.9.4
- Fix legacy's styles

## 5.9.3
- Chatwork updated again, which made Chat++ break. This small path brings some Chat++'s features back. However the emoticon feature does not work, and it will be fixed in another update later, when we manage to find how to handle Chatwork's changes.

## 5.9.2
- Chatwork updated their UI again, which made Chat++'s custom buttons in Chat Send Tool disapprear. The new version bring them back

## 5.9.1

- Fix bug duplicate Quote message

## 5.9.0

- Chatwork updated again, which applied an extremely confusing logic which then made the quote feature broken. We added our own quote message feature to fix this.

## 5.8.3

- Fix bug with duplicate messages in Reply Message Panel
- Vertically align text in the same line with Chat++ emoticons

## 5.8.2

- Fix bug missing message content when rendering Chat++ emoticons

## 5.8.1

- Update new Mechanism to bring the Emoticons feature back again. However, the new Mechanism does not have as good performance as the old one (which does not work anymore), so you you should consider turning the Emoticon Feature off if you find that it makes your Chatwork become too slow.
- **Known Problem:** Chat++'s emoticons in the current room are not displayed when Chatwork is first loaded. We will try to fix this problem in the next release.

## 5.8.0

- Temporarily disable emoticon feature due to Chatwork's code changed

## 5.7.1

- Chatwork updated their codes again, which made some features of Chat++ broken (including emoticons feature). This patch fixed the problem.

- Bring shortcut feature for some buttons (Edit, Link, Task, Quote) back

## 5.6.2

- Little change to make DOM replaced mechanism more stable

## 5.6.1

- Chatwork updated again!!!, which conflicts with current Chat++'s mechanism to display Emoticons, and causes errors when editting message. Therefore, we temporarily switch to DOM replaced mechanism, which is much less efficient, but at least, it works (^^;). We will try to find other way to bring the old mechanism back.

## 5.6.0

- Update new mechanism to bring the Emoticons feature back, by disabling rendering by AST. This method intervenes quite deeply into the way Chatwork's frontend works, and it probably will not be valid anymore in the future. However, we will try to fix again when it is broken.

## 5.5.1

- Temporarily disable new emoticons mechanism due to a critical bug with editting message. The feature will be turned on again when we can find the way to fix the problem.
